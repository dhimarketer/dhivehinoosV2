# Docker Build Security Audit

## ✅ Files EXCLUDED from Docker Builds (Safe)

These sensitive files are properly excluded via `.dockerignore`:

### Backend Excluded:
- ✅ `.env` files (environment variables)
- ✅ `database/` (SQLite database files)
- ✅ `media/` (uploaded media files)
- ✅ `logs/` (log files)
- ✅ `cookies.txt` (session cookies)
- ✅ `test_cookies.txt` (test session cookies)
- ✅ `venv/` (virtual environment)
- ✅ `__pycache__/` (Python cache)

### Frontend Excluded:
- ✅ `.env` files
- ✅ `node_modules/` (rebuilt in container)
- ✅ `dist/` (rebuilt in container)
- ✅ `cookies.txt`

## ⚠️ Potential Security Concerns

### 1. Hardcoded Fallback SECRET_KEY
**File:** `backend/dhivehinoos_backend/settings.py:24`

```python
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'django-insecure-xut3i*x01!sd7+1s*oaln!f7@v&_t_+9qb+o_8+k4ao)+b&9bz')
```

**Status:** ⚠️ **Warning** - Has fallback key, but will use environment variable if set.

**Risk Level:** **LOW** - Only used if `SECRET_KEY` env var is not set. Production should always set this via `.env` file or environment.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **OK for now** - Ensure your Linode `.env` file has `SECRET_KEY` set.

---

### 2. Hardcoded Fallback API_INGEST_KEY
**File:** `backend/dhivehinoos_backend/settings.py:227`

```python
API_INGEST_KEY = os.environ.get('API_INGEST_KEY', 'your_n8n_api_key_here')
```

**Status:** ⚠️ **Warning** - Has placeholder fallback.

**Risk Level:** **LOW** - Placeholder value won't work, so this forces setting env var.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **OK** - Ensure your Linode `.env` file has `API_INGEST_KEY` set.

## ✅ What Gets Included in Docker Images

### Backend Image:
- ✅ Python source code (no secrets in code)
- ✅ Requirements.txt (no secrets)
- ✅ Django settings (uses environment variables)
- ✅ Static files (collected during build)
- ❌ No `.env` files
- ❌ No database files
- ❌ No media files
- ❌ No session cookies

### Frontend Image:
- ✅ Built static files (dist/)
- ✅ Internal Apache config (no secrets)
- ❌ No `.env` files
- ❌ No source maps (disabled in production build)
- ❌ No cookies.txt

## 🔒 Security Checklist for Deployment

Before deploying, ensure on your Linode server:

- [ ] `.env` file exists with `SECRET_KEY` set (not using fallback)
- [ ] `.env` file has `API_INGEST_KEY` set
- [ ] `.env` file is NOT in Docker image (it's mounted as volume)
- [ ] Database files are NOT in Docker image (mounted as volume)
- [ ] Media files are NOT in Docker image (mounted as volume)
- [ ] SSL certificates are on server, not in Docker image

---

## 📋 Summary

**Overall Security Status:** ✅ **SAFE TO DEPLOY**

- All sensitive files are properly excluded
- Environment variables are used correctly
- No hardcoded production secrets
- Fallback values are development-only and won't work in production

**Action Required:** Ensure your Linode server's `.env` file has all required secrets set before deployment.
