# Robots.txt Diagnosis - Step by Step Analysis

## What We Know:
1. ✅ Backend route works: `curl -H "Host: dhivehinoos.net" http://127.0.0.1:8052/robots.txt` returns correct content
2. ❌ Apache proxy/alias not working: All attempts fail with 404
3. ❌ Even physical file with Alias didn't work - this is KEY

## Critical Observation:
The access log shows requests going to `/var/log/apache2/dhivehinoos_access.log` but the config specifies `dhivehinoos_ssl_access.log`. This suggests:
- Maybe the HTTP (port 80) VirtualHost is catching requests first
- OR a different config file is being used
- OR there's a redirect happening

## Possible Issues:

### 1. HTTP VirtualHost catching first
If there's an HTTP (port 80) VirtualHost that redirects to HTTPS, it might be catching robots.txt first. We need to check the HTTP config.

### 2. Wrong config file
Maybe `dhivehinoos.conf` isn't the active config. Check what's actually enabled:
```bash
ls -la /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ | grep dhivehinoos
```

### 3. Frontend container catching it
The frontend container's Apache has React Router rewrite rules. If the request somehow reaches it, it serves index.html.

### 4. Order of processing
Apache processes directives in a specific order. Alias should work, but maybe ProxyPass is processing first.

## Next Steps to Diagnose:

1. Check which configs are actually enabled
2. Check if there's an HTTP VirtualHost interfering
3. Test with a simple file to verify Alias works at all
4. Check if the file actually exists where we think it does
