# Quick Webhook Test Fix Deployment

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

The webhook test is working correctly locally, but the updated code hasn't been deployed to your Linode server yet. You need to deploy the latest changes.

## 🚀 **Deploy the Fix**

Run these commands on your **Linode server**:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project directory
cd /opt/dhivehinoos

# 2. Pull the latest Docker images
docker pull dhimarketer/backend:latest
docker pull dhimarketer/frontend:latest

# 3. Stop current containers
docker-compose down

# 4. Start with new images
docker-compose up -d

# 5. Wait for services to be ready
sleep 30

# 6. Check if services are running
docker-compose ps
```

## 🔍 **Alternative: Use the Full Deployment Script**

If you prefer, use the complete deployment script:

```bash
cd /opt/dhivehinoos
sudo ./deploy_linode.sh
```

## ✅ **After Deployment**

1. **Clear your browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Log out and log back in** to the admin panel
3. **Go to Settings → Webhook Settings**
4. **Enable the webhook** and set your URL
5. **Click "Test Webhook"**

## 🧪 **Test the Webhook**

The webhook test should now work correctly and show:
- ✅ **"Webhook test successful"** if your n8n endpoint is working
- ⚠️ **"Webhook test failed"** with specific error if there's an issue with your URL

## 📋 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

- ✅ **Authentication required** for webhook testing
- ✅ **Proper error messages** instead of "webhook disabled"
- ✅ **Real webhook testing** that sends data to your n8n instance
- ✅ **Settings refresh** after saving

## 🔧 **If Still Not Working**

1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Check if you're logged in** as admin
3. **Try incognito/private browsing** to avoid cache issues
4. **Check Docker logs**: `docker-compose logs dhivehinoos_backend`

The fix is ready - you just need to deploy it! 🚀
